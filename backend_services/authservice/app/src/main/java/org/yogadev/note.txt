stateless session in a web application, particularly in the context of security and authentication, it means that the server does not maintain
any information about the user's session between requests.
Each request from the client is treated independently, and the server does not store any session-related data.


No Persistent Session State:
    Since the session is stateless, the server does not keep track of user sessions.
    Therefore, the SecurityContext will be null on every request unless the user provides authentication credentials (like a token) with each request.


Need to check SessionID present (or) not.
